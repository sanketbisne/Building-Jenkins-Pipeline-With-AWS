The end of this course will lead to a project where you can show your acquired skills taught in this course. In our project, you will deploy and run an instance on AWS, configure Jenkins, and create a pipeline to deploy a static website on S3.

CFEngine earlier it was used
now jenkins



    Continuous Integration means newly developed code changes of a project are periodically built, tested, and integrated into a shared repository like Git. Then, the integrated code is verified and tested using automated tools.

    Continuous Delivery is the process of automating the release of the merged and validated code to a repository and finally release a production-ready build to the production environment.
