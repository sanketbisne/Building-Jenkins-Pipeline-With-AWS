CI/CD is a consistent and automated way for a DevOps team to build, package, test, and deploy applications 


Continuous Integration means newly developed code changes of a project are periodically built, tested, and integrated into a shared repository like Git.Then, the integrated code is verified and tested using automated tools


Continuous Delivery is the process of automating the release of the merged and validated code to a repository and finally release a production-ready build to the production environment.
